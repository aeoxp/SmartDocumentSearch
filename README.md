# Smart Document Search MVP

## **Project Overview**

**Smart Document Search** is a **local-first, privacy-focused tool** designed to help consumers identify scams and access fraud protection tips. The app pulls information from trusted sources like the **FTC**, **AARP**, and the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**, using **semantic search** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, actionable insights.

---

## **Features**

* **Local-First**: All data processing occurs locally on your device for **fast** and **private** search results.
* **Privacy-by-Design**: Redacts sensitive data (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses) to protect user privacy.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines **semantic search** (FAISS + MiniLM) with **local answer generation** for accurate, contextually relevant responses.
* **Backend**: Built with **Express.js** and **MongoDB** for data storage and management.
* **Frontend**: Simple **Streamlit** interface that integrates with the backend to offer a smooth user experience.

---

## **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend**: **Streamlit** for user interface.
* **Backend**: **Express.js** for handling API requests and **MongoDB** for database management.
* **Search**: **FAISS** (vector search) combined with **MiniLM** (language model) for semantic retrieval.
* **Privacy**: **Redaction** for sensitive information (e.g., phone numbers, emails).
* **Security**: **Helmet**, **CORS**, **Zod** validation to ensure secure and reliable operation.
* **Logging**: **Pino** for structured logging and debugging.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

* **Node.js** and **npm** for running the backend.
* **Python 3.x** and **Streamlit** for the frontend.
* **MongoDB** running locally or in the cloud (URI configured in `.env`).

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartDocumentSearch_MVP.git
   cd SmartDocumentSearch_MVP
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:

   * Install Node.js dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   * Set up your **.env** file:

     ```env
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
     MONGODB_DB=mydb
     PORT=3000
     UI_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8501
     ```

   * Start the backend server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup** (Streamlit):

   * Install Python dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   * Start the Streamlit app:

     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

## **How to Use**

1. Open the **Streamlit frontend** in your browser: `http://localhost:8501`
2. In the sidebar, set the **Backend URL** to `http://localhost:3000` and check **"Use backend /search"**.
3. Enter queries to search for consumer protection tips or fraud prevention information, such as:

   * **"What are the four signs that something is a scam?"**
   * **"What is identity theft?"**

The system will return:

* **Backend Results** (from the trusted sources like the FTC, AARP, etc.)
* **Local Answers** generated by semantic retrieval (using **MiniLM**).

---

## **Future Enhancements**

* **Atlas Search**: Fuzzy search and autocomplete for better query handling.
* **Redis Cache**: For faster repeated searches.
* **JWT Authentication**: To secure user sessions.
* **PDF Uploads**: Allow PDF files to be converted to text and searched.
